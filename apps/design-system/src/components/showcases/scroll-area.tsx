					Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
					leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even
					in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop
					Jokester. And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the
					jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And
					once they started laughing, they couldn't stop. The king was so angry that
					he banished Jokester from the kingdom, but the people still laughed, and
					they laughed, and they laughed. And they all lived happily ever after.
