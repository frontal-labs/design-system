# Applications

This directory contains the applications that consume and demonstrate the design system packages.

## Existing Apps

- **[Storybook](./storybook)**: Component working environment and documentation.

## Needed Apps

The following applications are planned or recommended to complete the design system ecosystem:

- **Docs (`apps/docs`)**: A documentation website (e.g., Next.js + MDX) to host the public-facing documentation for the design system.
- **Playground (`apps/playground`)**: A Next.js application to test the design system in a real-world server-side rendering (SSR) environment and to serve as a playground for verifying bug fixes.
- **Web (`apps/web`)**: (Optional) A main website or landing page for the design system brand, if distinct from the docs.
